## How does this flow works

To send a SMS via Notification Service, a recipient, SMS template and notification category need to be setup before the actual message can be send. See also the Notification Service API descriptions to understand the overall workflow.
During execution of flow 1), the recipient is added and it's ID is stored to a context variable as part of the VFC flow. Next a message template and template-set is created. It's internal IDs are also stored in context variables for usage in flow 3). Here, the notification category is set by linking the template to recipient(s). It feedbacks a category-ID which is then finally used in flow 4) to trigger the sending of the notification. Also the message content is specified in the last flow.

## Result

After specifying recipient (name, phone number) as well as message text,

1. Execute flow *1) Create Recipient*
2. Execute flow *2) Create Template Set for the SMS*
3. Execute flow *3) Create Category to bind above recipient and template*
4. Execute flow *4) Send SMS using Category ID*

And you should receive a SMS on the mobile number specified. :iphone: :bell:
