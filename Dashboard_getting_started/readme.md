# VFC Dashboard - A Getting Started Example:
This example will guide you step by step through the VFC Dahsboard functionalities. You will create a simple but dynamic dashboard that shows the status of your three (simulated) machines that you already connected to Mindsphere. You will learn the essential nodes for dashboarding with the VFC and will be able to extend your dashboard according to your own needs. The Dashboard you create will look like this:

# Prerequisites:
- around 120 minutes of time
- Visual Flow Creator
- Asset Manager
- basic javascript knowledge is helpful, but not required
> All required applications and resources are part of a [Start for free](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/en/start) tenant. You can follow along this tutorial regardless of your mindsphere package.

# Setup:
We will simulate three different versions of an industrial machine:
- Basic
- Performance
- Eco

This step requires you to be familiar with Mindsphere's asset structure and can create new aspect and asset types. If this sounds like a big headache to you, please visit the [Asset Manager Tutorial](https://siemens.mindsphere.io/en/docs/tutorials/asset-manager) first.

If not, please follow the [Setup Instructions](./Setup/readme.md) and come back once you completed the process.

# Overview Dashboard:
Start by creating a new flow and name it something like *Dashboard* or *MyFirstDashboard*.
